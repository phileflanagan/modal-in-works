      <h2>THE LEIDEN COLLECTION</h2>
      <h2>EXHIBITION AROUND THE WORLD</h2>
      <p>Founded by Thomas S. Kaplan and Daphne Recanati Kaplan, The Leiden Collection, consisting of more than 250 paintings and drawings, is among the largest and most important collections of seventeenth-century Dutch art in private hands. It includes masterpieces by Rembrandt van Rijn and the fine painters of the Leiden school, including Gerrit Dou, Frans van Mieris, Gabriel Metsu and Godefridus Schalcken. It also features important works by other Dutch masters, among them, Frans Hals, Carel Fabritius, Jan Steen and Johannes Vermeer. Though heretofore almost entirely anonymous in its loans, The Leiden Collection has emerged as a lending library of Old Masters; over 170 loans of artworks have been made to date to major museums in Europe, the United States, and Japan. The traveling exhibition that is commencing at the Louvre marks the first occasion that a survey of highlights from The Leiden Collection will be presented to the public.</p>
